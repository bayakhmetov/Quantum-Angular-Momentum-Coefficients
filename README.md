# Quantum-Angular-Momentum-Coefficients
Calculates Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, Wigner's 6j- and 9j-symbols for given angular momenta.
The program is dedicated for theoretical physicists, students who study quantum theory of angular momentum, atomic and nuclear physics, nuclear models, nuclear reactions and etc. 
The program is easy to use. You may copy this code into your own project or py file.
